The nearest Northern Line station is Old Street which takes you to up Euston and Camden or down to Kennington and Clapham. Finally, the Central Line is accessible via Bethnal Green station and can be used to take you into Oxford Street and Notting Hill.

Stokie's shops overflow with indie labels and vintage goods and its restaurants are noteworthy for their diversity as well as their quality. Of course much of N16's success is down to the remarkably strong presence of independent business in the area, making it a truly distinctive part of the capital. You are also 10 minute walk from Clissold Park which is one of Hackneys best loved traditional parks with deers and farm animals.",
